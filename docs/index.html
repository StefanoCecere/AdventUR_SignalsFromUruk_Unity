    An augmented cards Sumeric party adventure game! Transmission of information requires a language, and the first written language
    is the one of the Sumerians. Our game will bring you into an adventure in the world of the Smerians, in the town of Uruk,
    where Gilgamesh rules. Print the cards, get the augmented reality app and start playing!
